## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Plant Pro / Plant 4.0 BLE support using the FluvalConnect `fff0`/`fff1`/`fff2`
  mesh/SPP protocol (`0xD1` + CBOR).
- Native Plant Pro / 4.0 weather effects through the Home Assistant light
  effect control.
- Native Plant Pro / 4.0 Auto schedule writes using the fixture's sunrise,
  sunset, sleep, day-level, and night-level packet fields.
- Native Plant Pro / 4.0 Professional schedule writes using fixture-side
  point-schedule storage.
- Plant Pro / 4.0 lamp profile with Red / Blue / Cool White / Warm White /
  Amber channel labels.
- Bluetooth discovery matchers for Plant Pro, Plant 4.0, Reef 4.0, and Reef
  Nano 4.0 names while preserving strict filtering against generic mesh devices.
- Tests covering Plant Pro / 4.0 packet shapes, mixed-service GATT resolution,
  discovery matching, effects, native schedule services, and HA schedule
  compatibility.

### Changed
- Default BLE active connection window increased from 120 s to **300 s**; advertisements extend an open session so commands need fewer cold reconnects.
- **Reachable** binary sensor now re-evaluates when `last_seen` ages out instead of staying stuck on.
- **`active_time: 0`** keeps the GATT session connected permanently (connects on integration load).
- **Reachable** reflects recent BLE advertisements only; `gatt_connected` is still exposed in attributes.
- Default **`active_time` is 0** (always connected) for local use.
- Mesh / Plant Pro devices that expose both old `1000` and mesh `fff0` services
  now prefer the mesh `fff2` write and `fff1` notify characteristics.
- Home Assistant runtime data handling now preserves HA-managed schedule mode and
  locking across the newer config-entry runtime-data lifecycle.

### Credits
- Plant Pro / 4.0 packet behavior was informed by FluvalConnect APK
  reverse-engineering.
- Plant Pro / 4.0 protocol design was cross-checked against
  [cryystyy/fluval-plant-pro-4-homeassistant](https://github.com/cryystyy/fluval-plant-pro-4-homeassistant).
- Hardware behavior and Home Assistant integration refinements by
  [@Wheemer](https://github.com/Wheemer).
- Original Fluval BLE integration and upstream project maintained by
  [@MrMooreUK](https://github.com/MrMooreUK) and prior contributors.

## [0.0.32] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Real **light entity** with proper translation: Plant/Marine RGB ↔ Rose/Blue/CW/PW/WW (preview matches mix); AquaSky native RGBW.
- AquaSky 3.0/FACEBD discovery, diagnostics, and write support.
- Lovelace schedule, spectrum bar, and wavelength preview cards.
- HA-managed schedule storage, auto mode, and physical preview services.
- **Lamp type** option (Plant / AquaSky 2.0 / AquaSky 3.0 / auto) with Plant channel labels (Rose / Blue / Cold White / Pure White / Warm White).
- **Sync clock** button and automatic RTC sync on connect (old `0x0E`, FACEBD keys 101/102, mesh `0xCD`).
- Experimental **mesh** (`0000fff0`) support: `0xD1` + CBOR framing.

### Changed
- Per-channel number sliders disabled by default (advanced); use the Light entity as primary control.
- Channel entities use 0–100% consistently; old BLE wire scale (0–1000) is converted on decode.
- Prefer BLE write-without-response when available (ESPHome-compatible, Aquasky 2.0).
- Skip unchanged channel writes and throttle physical preview writes.
- Options changes reload the integration so ping/active-time take effect.

### Fixed
- Restored AquaSky colours remain synchronized with the Home Assistant icon after power-on.
- Options Configure gear 500 (`OptionsFlow` / missing `config_entry`) — #16.
- Plant devices mis-identified as AquaSky — #17.
- AquaSky 3.0 names no longer forced to 4 channels.
- Clock sync retries after BLE disconnect/reconnect (#8).
- Preview stop/restore behavior and FACEBD write target handling.
- Removed dead send-queue / legacy state-packet paths; public schedule helpers.

### Notes
- Clock sync, Aquasky 2.0 write behaviour, and mesh path still need hardware validation.
- For issues with other Fluval lights, please open a GitHub issue with the
  model, Home Assistant version, diagnostics output, and relevant logs.

## [0.0.6] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **`docs/bug-triage.md`** — internal triage document for the two
  currently-open bugs (#6 Aquasky 2.0 no response, #8 schedule drift
  after power cut), with what we know, what we need from reporters,
  and the workarounds to use in the meantime.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — contributor guidance (dev branch workflow,
  test expectations, local linting, release process).
- **`AGENTS.md`** — guidance for AI coding agents working in this repo
  (test commands, branch rules, what _not_ to change).
- **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** — `ruff format` + `ruff check` run on
  every commit.
- **`mypy` in CI** — soft, non-gating static type-checking job.
  Reports existing type errors in the job log so progress is visible
  as the integration gains type hints.
- **`pytest-cov` in CI** — coverage report uploaded to Codecov when
  the `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret is configured. The job degrades
  gracefully without it.
- **`pyproject.toml` config** — `[tool.mypy]` and `[tool.coverage.*]`
  sections, with a 33% coverage floor.

## [0.0.5] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Light entity** — a master dimmer (`light.fluval_xxxx_light`) that turns the fixture
  on/off and sets overall brightness, scaling all channels together while preserving
  their relative ratios. Works with HA light cards, voice assistants, and light
  automations. The per-channel number sliders remain for fine control.

### Fixed
- **BLE client stays reusable after idle** — previously the client called
  `_safe_disconnect()` when the active window expired, leaving the device unavailable
  on some HA Bluetooth proxy setups until the config entry was reloaded. The client
  now stays alive; a subsequent command wakes and reconnects it automatically.
- **Ping restart guard** — `ping()` now returns immediately if the client has been
  stopped, preventing an accidental restart after the integration is unloaded.
- **Entity sync after channel change** — `updates_component` handlers (which push
  state to HA) now fire on every channel change, not only when switching modes.
  Previously, sliders in manual mode wouldn't update each other or the new light entity.

### Changed
- **Protocol constants** — command bytes (`CMD_HEADER`, `CMD_MODE`, `CMD_SWITCH`,
  `CMD_BRIGHTNESS`, `CMD_STATUS`) are now named constants in `core/__init__.py`
  instead of inline magic numbers, making the BLE command set self-documenting.

## [0.0.4] — 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Entity availability on disconnect** — switch, channel sliders and mode selector now
  correctly become _unavailable_ when the Fluval light goes offline (previously they
  stayed shown as available with stale values, misleading users into thinking commands
  were being sent).

### Added
- **Options flow** — after setup, open _Settings → Devices & Services → Fluval Aquarium
  LED → Configure_ to tune the keep-alive interval (5–60 s, default 10 s) and the
  active-connection window (30–600 s, default 120 s) without removing and re-adding
  the integration.
- **Entity icons** — switch shows `mdi:led-strip-variant`, channel sliders show
  `mdi:brightness-6`, and the mode selector shows `mdi:tune`.
- **Brightness sliders** — channel number entities now render as sliders in the HA UI
  instead of plain text input boxes (`NumberMode.SLIDER`).
- **Better device titles** — when a light is found via Bluetooth auto-discovery the
  entry title now uses the BLE advertised name (e.g. "Fluval Plant 3.0") instead of
  the raw MAC address.
- **Model detection** — device card in HA shows "Aquasky 2.0" or "Aquarium LED 3.0"
  based on the channel count detected from the first state packet.
- **`loggers` in manifest.json** — users can now enable debug-level logging for the
  integration via HA's _Logger_ UI (`Settings → System → Logs → Set custom logger`
  and choose `custom_components.fluvalble`).
- **`PARALLEL_UPDATES = 0`** — declared on all entity platforms (correct for
  push-based `local_push` integrations).
- **`domains` in hacs.json** — HACS now correctly associates the integration with
  its domain.
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions workflows for automated linting, testing, and release
  asset publishing.

## [0.0.3] — 2025-12-01

### Added
- Bluetooth auto-discovery — Home Assistant prompts to add the light when it is seen
  via BLE advertisement (no manual MAC entry required).
- Entity translation strings — proper names and state labels for all entities.
- Keep-alive reconnect loop — connection is automatically re-established after drops.
- BLE packet reassembly — correctly handles split Fluval notifications.

### Fixed
- Short-packet crash on malformed BLE notifications.
- `channel_5` entity incorrectly shown for 4-channel Aquasky 2.0 lamps.

---

## [0.0.2] — 2025-10-15

### Added
- Manual Bluetooth MAC address entry in the config flow.
- Discovered-device picker — lists nearby Fluval lights filtered by service UUID.
- Mode select entity (manual / automatic / professional).
- Binary sensor for BLE connection status (diagnostic category).

### Fixed
- Smart mode switching — channel brightness commands now automatically switch the
  lamp to manual mode first so changes take effect immediately.

---

## [0.0.1] — 2025-09-01

### Added
- Initial release.
- BLE client using `bleak` and `bleak-retry-connector`.
- Switch entity for LED on/off.
- Number entities for up to 5 brightness channels.
- AES-style packet encryption matching the Fluval/Planted Tank BLE protocol.
